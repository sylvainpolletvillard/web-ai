          What is a LLM (source

        </h1>
        <p>
          A large language model (LLM) is a language model trained with
          self-supervised machine learning on a vast amount of text, designed
          for natural language processing tasks, especially language generation.
        </p>
        <p>
          The largest and most capable LLMs are generative pretrained
          transformers (GPTs), which are largely used in generative chatbots
          such as ChatGPT, Gemini or Claude. LLMs can be fine-tuned for specific
          tasks or guided by prompt engineering.[1] These models acquire
          predictive power regarding syntax, semantics, and ontologies[2]
          inherent in human language corpora, but they also inherit inaccuracies
          and biases present in the data they are trained in.
